### About me

I’m a software developer located in Germany/Gießen. My professional career is tightly coupled to the Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH where I currently develop embedded linux gateways.

My opinion about programming is that no one should ever be scared of using new technologies or methods in order to reach a goal. With this approach you will always find yourself in interesting and challenging environments and your work will not be to boring.

I might say that I discovered following areas of software engineering fields quite deep:
- (embedded) linux development
  - kernel configuration
  - distro builders: yocto and buildroot
  - programming languages: c/cpp, lua, rust
  - build systems: make, autoconf, cmake
  - protocols and interfaces: can, modbus, mqtt
  - linux tools: systemd, sysv
  - networking
- virtualization and infrastructure:
  - automatic software setup via ansible
  - ci/cd via docker and k8
  - minimal os like: unraidOS, coreOS
  - hardware virtualization with qemu
- automatic testing:
  - test implementation with general purpose test frameworks: pytest, robotframework
  - hardware in the loop tests
- open source software compliance
- functional programming
- reactive programming
